preference for managing node via Volta


`npm install`
`npm start`

if we ever want to build/test for "production"/"release"
`npm run build`
`npm run preview`

## TODO: github pages
https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy

ideally we would update to the latest LTS node
(and I think a newer version of vite?)
